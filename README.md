# Autonomous Robot
Source code for the autonomous robot I assembled and programmed for a CS class at UCSD. This repo was cloned from a template provided by the TAs of the course.

## Open Loop Control
For the first homework assignment, I implemented autonomous traversal using open loop control and a [kinematic model](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamid-Taheri-8/publication/276344731_Kinematic_Model_of_a_Four_Mecanum_Wheeled_Mobile_Robot/links/61fafa65007fb5044730fe2e/Kinematic-Model-of-a-Four-Mecanum-Wheeled-Mobile-Robot.pdf) for mecanum wheeled robots. 

A demo of the implementation can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/wMhaILRnkFI).

## Closed Loop Control
Coming soon!
